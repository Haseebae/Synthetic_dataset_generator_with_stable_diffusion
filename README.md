# Synthetic_dataset_generator_with_stable_diffusion
streamlit app that uses a fine tuned SDXL model to generate synthetic indian road images using intuitive and novel control methods

A state of the art model trained using cutting-edge techniques, including discriminators, and implemented advanced fine-tuning for the SD models. 
This fusion of innovation, combined with our meticulous process of precision - fine-tuned on refiners, rigorously trained on our exclusive dataset, and rigorously scrutinized by discriminators - is the heart of our authenticity.

We take 5 types of user Input :

Any location pin
An image Input 
Text Prompt 
A form with various options, for example â€“ Road condition, Weather, obstacles, etc.
Any combinations of the above


We suggest to use atleast two control methods to generate better results
